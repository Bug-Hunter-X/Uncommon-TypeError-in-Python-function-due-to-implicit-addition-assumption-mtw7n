# Uncommon Python TypeError: Implicit Addition Assumption

This repository demonstrates a subtle and uncommon TypeError in Python that can occur when functions implicitly assume the addition ('+') operator will always work on their return values.  The bug manifests when the function's return value is an object that doesn't support the '+' operator (like a dictionary in this case).  The solution involves adding explicit type checking or using alternative methods to handle various input types.
